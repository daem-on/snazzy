<h1>Snazzy.</h1>
<p>
    This game is an implementation of Cards Against Humanity, much like
    <i>Pretend You're Xyzzy</i>. <b>Under development.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Design differences to PTYX: user interface was designed in a completely
    different way, with more emphasis on good UX and aesthetics.
    Responses are merged into calls when cards are revealed.
    The whole game can be easily self-hosted anywhere.
